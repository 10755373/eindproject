## Final report

Please have a look at my report!


## Introduction

Numerous studies have been conducted throughout the last several years regarding the absolute numbers of suicides as well as the ratio of suicides (mostly per 100.000 capita) in countries worldwide. Despite the fact that it's not the nicest research topic to have, I decided to have a look at it simply because they all had ended up with different outcomes and conclusions. In some countries they found out that the number of suicides amongst men was vastly decreasing and the number of woman slightly increasing, whilst the number was sharply increasing for both genders in other countries. This draw my attention for several reasons: first of all the huge differences between countries, second the differences between men and woman (in different age groups as well) and third the time lapse over which the investigations took place. With those questions in mind, I decided that this was a good topic for my research since I could combine several parts in the visuals: differences between countries, genders, age groups, absolute numbers and ratio's. My idea was to see if the patterns and conclusions that previous studies have proven, are indeed visable when plotting open-source data in visuals. In order to do that, I came up with the following website:


## Website

At first, the user is redirected to the home page at which he/she get's to read a short introduction to the topic and why I decided to take this topic for my research. At the bottom of the page is a button which leads to the visualization page after clicking on it. Again, a short description is provided above the visuals as a short introduction to all the visuals the user is going to see at the page. Then, time for the most important part: the visuals. The first two visuals are a worldmap and a scatterplot. Above the visuals are two dropdown options for the user: the first one is one for choosing the gender and the second for the age group (the worldmap and scatterplot are set on female and 5-14 years as default). The data is shown in the graps as follows: the worldmap shows the absolute number of suicides and the scatterplot the absolute number on the x axis and the ratio (per 100.000 capita) on the y axis. Furthermore, the numbers and colours change when hovering over the time slider (beneath the visuals) in both graphics. Last, both visuals are provided with a tooltip which shows the country when hovering over either the country (in the worldmap) or dot (in the scatterplot). In this way, the user is provided with two visuals which clearly show the differences between countries for years between 1987 and 2015.

The first two visuals are made to compare countries with each other, but to have a closer look at the differences in a particular country regarding genders and age groups, two more visuals are provided to the user below the first two. By clicking on a country in the worldmap, the user can see can see the numbers in a linegraph and a pie- and donutchart (note: those visuals are already shown, but for The Netherlands with data for 1987 in absolute numbers and the age group 5-14 year set as default). Again, those visuals are connected to two dropdown options: the first one is for the numbers (absolute or as a ratio) and the second for the age group. The linegraph shows the data over the time period for which there was data for both genders. The blue line is for males and the pink one for females, but to make it extra clear a tooltip is imbedded in the linegraph. This function is called when the mouse enters one of the lines and shows either "Males" or "Females" on top of the chart and it disappears after leaving the line with the mouse. To the right of the linegraph are two more visuals shown: a piechart and a donutchart. The piechart shows either the absolute number or ratio of suicides (depending of the option the user chose in the first dropdown) in the year in the time slider. The donutchart shows the amount of people in the age group (the second option in the dropdown) in the same year. Both graps are provided with a tooltip which, just as with the one for the linegraph, is visable when entering the chart and disappears when leaving the chart. The tooltip shows the numbers in both visuals.

As extra, a click-function is made just below the last two visuals which provide the user with extra information about the linegraph and pie - and donutchart when the users clicks on it.

In the navigation-bar above the page, three more subpages are made: the first one is for links, the second for background information and the last one to enter my github page. The link-page is giving extra information about the pages which I visited to get idea's regarding the research topic and visualizations. The background information-page is telling a bit more about my motivation for choosing this topic and the link to github is to offer the user the opportunity to have a look at all the code which is making this website.


## Story

I've built the website in such way that the user is going through the data and information step-by-step. So first by presenting a short introduction on the homepage so the user knows which topic he or she is going to be informed about. After that is the redirecting to the visualization page which is going through the data step-by-step as well as having a distinction between different topics (comparing countries with each other and comparing genders in a certain country with each other). After the user has seen this all, there are possibilities to gain background information, have a look a links or the code. In this way it's clear what's going on at every stage in the website and in the same time it's offering not too much, but convenient information.



## Challenges

Well, this is a long story but I'll try to make a short version of it. In the beginning I had a dataset and reasearch topic but this wasn't exactly what I wished for (as in, I couldn't do much with it so it wasn't very challenging for me). So after a week I found the topic and dataset I used during the rest of the project which meant that I was behind with a whole week! This immediately meant that I had to work very structured and organised as well as very very hard the upcoming weeks. This obviously caused some troubles such as not having in mind which functions to use and how to structure my github. In the beginning I just started working in one file but very shortly I figured out that this was a mission impossible. Therefore, I decided to order everything into folders with functions placed into several, separated files.
The devision between functions and programming languages was one of the best ideas if I'm honest. Here's why:
Several functions are making sure that the correct data is passed on to the visualizations. At first, the complete dataset is loaded into a function called "main.js" which then is being used during the rest of the code. Depending on the decisions the user is making, certain columns or rows in the datatset are then retrieved out of this dataset. This is convenient in a couple of ways: first of all, it's making sure that the website is not lacking when hovering fast over the time-slider or choosing quickly between options in the dropdowns simply because of the fact that it's searching for and then using tiny bits of data out of the dataset. In the beginning, I let the functions search through the complete data which took so long that the website was causing error on error and eventually crashed. The second advantage from having functions strictly separated from each other and let them only doing things when being called, is that it's the overall structure of the code is clear and the overview is being hold. In the beginning it was duable to have functions doing more than one thing but after extending the website with more and more options it became unbearable for the running time as well the overview for me during the actual of the website. Furthermore, a filed called "helpers.js" is made in which all the stuff happens regarding retrieving data for the visuals, timeslider and colors. This is being done to have to initialization and update functions regarding the visualizations focused only on making them and nothing else.
My challenges changed almost daily: in the beginning it was finding data, then matching countries with the country Alpha-3 code, loading csv-data into a correct and usable json-format, but then the real challenges began. First choosing the right visuals, then making them, making a function for initialzing and one for updating them, adding interactions between them and lastly the page layout. The hardest part as by far updating the graps and making sure that functions were actually retrieving the right values from the options and the giving the right data to the visual functions. The interaction made me crazy because there where so many things had you had to keep in mind but it was the most exiting thing to do as well because it let you think very organised about how you wanted to organise every part of your website.
